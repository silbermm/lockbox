## What is it
A simple and secure password manager. It only saves passwords on your computer and never sends them to some server in some cloud that could potentially be compromised. 

In the case that you want your passwords synced across your other devices, there is an optional service that uses Bluetooth and Public/Private key encryption to validate device identity and perform P2P syncing.
